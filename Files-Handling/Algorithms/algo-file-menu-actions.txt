    5.12: Case option = 3
        5.12.1: delete_line(file_path)
    5.13: Case option = 4
        5.13.1: search_string(file_path)
    5.14: Case option = 5
        5.14.1: content ‚Üê file_read(file_path)
        5.14.2: Print content
    5.15: Case option = 6
        5.15.1: Print "Program exited."
        5.15.2: Exit
    5.16: Case Default
        5.16.1: Print "Invalid option. Please try again."
    5.17: EndCase
5: EndWhile
6: Stop
