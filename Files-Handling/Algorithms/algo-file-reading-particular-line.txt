Output: Display the specified lines
Data Structure:- One Dimensional Array (lines)

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "Enter file path: "
3: Read file_path
4: If file_check(file_path) = NULL then
    4.1: Exit
5: EndIf

6: Print "Which lines to be printed? "
7: Read lines // line numbers to be printed

8: content ← file_read(file_path)
9: count ← 1
10: For each line in content do
    10.1: count ← count + 1
    10.2: If count in lines then
        10.2.1: Print line
    10.3: EndIf
11: EndFor
