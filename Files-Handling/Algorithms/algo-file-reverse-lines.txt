                Algorithm - Printing lines of a file in reverse order

Input:- Path of a file (file_path)
Output:- Print the lines of the file in reverse order
Data Structure:- Stack
Discussion:-    Stack is used to store the lines of the file. 
                The lines are pushed into the stack and 
                then popped out to print them in reverse order.

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Read file_path
3: If file_check(file_path) = NULL then
    3.1: Print "File not found or inaccesible!"
    3.2: Exit
4: EndIf

5: content ‚Üê file_read(file_path)
6: For each line in content do
    6.1: stack_push(line)
7: EndFor
8: While stack is not empty do
    8.1: Print stack_pop()
9: EndWhile
10: Stop
