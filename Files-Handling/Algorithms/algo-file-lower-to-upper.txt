                Algorithm - File-Lower-To-Upper

Input:- Path of the file (file_name)
Output:- A proper message for successful operation and failure.

Discussion:-
        tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < "$file_name" > "$file_name.tmp"
        This shell command is used to translate or delete strings
        We used it to convert the strings to upper case and store it in temporary file.
        mv(file_name.tmp, file_name)
        We then use mv command to move the content of the temporary file to the original file.
        Effectively overwriting the original file with the upper case content.

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "Enter file path: "
3: Read file_path // Name of the file
4: If file_check(file_path) = NULL then // check if the file exists
    4.1: Print file_path, " doesn't exist."
    4.2: Stop
5: EndIf
6: file_content ← file_read(file_path) // read the content of the file
7: file_content ← toupper(file_content) // convert the content to upper case
8: file_write(file_path, file_content) // overwrite the contents of the file
9: Print "Content has been successfully converted to upper case."
10: Stop
