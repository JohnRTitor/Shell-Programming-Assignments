                Algorithm - Reading particular lines in a file

Input: Name of the file: file_name, Starting line number : start, Ending line number : end
Output: display the lines within the range [start, stop]

Steps:-

1: Start
2: If file_check(file_name) = NULL then
    2.1: Exit
3: EndIf
4: count=0
5: While line ≠ EOF do
    5.1: count ← count+1
    5.2: If count >= start && count <= stop then
        5.2.1: Print line
    5.3: EndIf
6: EndWhile
7: Stop
