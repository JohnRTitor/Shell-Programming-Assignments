3: If file_check(file_name) = NULL then
    3.1: Exit
4: EndIf

5: Print "Enter the starting line number: "
6: Read start
7: Print "Enter the ending line number: "
8: Read stop

9: content ← file_read(file_name)
10: count ← 0
11: For each line in content do
    11.1: count ← count + 1
    11.2: If count >= start AND count <= stop then
        11.2.1: Print line
    11.3: EndIf
12: EndFor
