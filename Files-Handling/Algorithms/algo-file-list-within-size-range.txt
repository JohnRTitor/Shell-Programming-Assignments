               Algorithm - Finding files with size in a specified range in the current directory

Input:- minimum file size : min_size, maximum file size : max_size
Output:- Display the names of the files in the current directory that have file size within the specified range.
Discussion:- The function find_files() is used to find all the files within the specified range [min_size,max_size] in the current directory

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "Enter the minimum file size: "
3: Read min_size
4: Print "Enter the maximum file size: "
5: Read max_size
6: current_directory ← get_current_directory()
7: file_list ← find_files(current_directory)
8: Print "Files with size in the range [", min_size, ",", max_size, "]"
9: For each file in file_list do
    9.1: If min_size <= file_size(size) AND file_size(file) <= max_size then
        9.1.1: Print file
    9.2: EndIf
10: EndFor
11: Stop
