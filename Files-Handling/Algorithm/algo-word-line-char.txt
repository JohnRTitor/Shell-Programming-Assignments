                Algorithm - Word-Line-Character-Count

Input: Path of the file (file_name)
Output: Display the number of lines, words and character in the file
Data Structure: One Dimensional Array

Steps:

1: Start
2: Print "Enter file path: "
3: Read file_path //Name of the file
4: If NOT check_file(file_path) // check if the file exists
    4.1: Print file_path, " doesn't exist."
    4.2: Stop
5: EndIf
6: values_array ‚Üê file_count(file_path, LINE, WORD, CHAR) // Used to count lines, words and characters
// Equivalent to wc -l -w -m file_path command in Linux
// Returns three values in an array
7: Print values_array[0] //Number of lines in the file
8: Print values_array[1] //Number of words in the file
9: Print values_array[2] //Number of characters in the file
10: Stop
