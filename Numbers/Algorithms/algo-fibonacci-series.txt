                Algorithm: Fibonacci Series

Input:- The number of terms (terms)
Output:- The Fibonacci series containing that number of terms

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "How many terms you want to print? "
3: Read terms
4: If terms < 1 then
    4.1: Print "Invalid terms count."
    4.2: Stop
5: EndIf
6: Print "The fibonacci series is: "
7: num1 ← 0, num2 ← 1 // first two terms
8: Print num1, num2
9: For i = 3 to terms do
    9.1: nextnum ← num1 + num2
    // print the series
    9.2: Print nextnum
    9.3: num1 ← num2, num2 ← nextnum
    9.4: i ← i + 1
10: EndFor
