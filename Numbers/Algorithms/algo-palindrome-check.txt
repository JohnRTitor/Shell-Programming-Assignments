                Algorithm: Palindrome number checking

Input:- A number (num)
Output:- Whether the number is palindrome or not

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "Enter the number: "
3: Read num
4: temp ← num, reverse ← 0 // temp is a temporary variable used to calculate the reverse
5: While temp < 0 do
    // calculate the remainder, to get the last digit
    5.1: rem ← temp % 10
    // add to reverse
    5.2: reverse ← reverse * 10 + rem
    # trim the last digit
    5.3: temp ← temp / 10
6: EndWhile
7: Print "The reverse of ", num, " is ", reverse
8: If num = reverse then
    8.1: Print num, " is palindrome."
9: Else
    9.1: num, " is not palindrome."
10: EndIf
11: Stop
