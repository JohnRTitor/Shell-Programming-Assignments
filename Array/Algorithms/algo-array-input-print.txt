            Algorithm - Array Input and Output

Input:- An array of numbers (arr)
Output:- Display the elements of the array (arr)
Data Structure:- One Dimensional Array
Discussion:- size is the size of the array.
            In Bash, there is no need to read the size of the array.
            As we can parse the elements directly and determine the size at run time

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "Enter the size: "
3: Read size
4: For i = 0 to size - 1 do
    4.1: Read arr[i]
5: EndFor
6: Print "The elements of the array are: "
7: For i = 0 to size - 1 do
    7.1: Print arr[i]
8: EndFor
9: Stop
