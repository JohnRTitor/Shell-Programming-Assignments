                    Algorithm - Array Size

Input:- A array of numbers (arr)
Output:- The size of the array (size)
Discussion:-
            Equivalent to Bash expression: size=${#numbers[@]}
            In Python, and other languages, the size of an array can be determined
            by using the len or similar function at runtime

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "Enter space-separated numbers: "
3: Read arr
4: size = 0
5: For each num in arr do
    5.1: size ‚Üê size + 1
6: EndFor
7: Print "The size of the array is ", size
8: Stop
