            Algorithm - Insertion Sort

Input: An array of numbers : array
Output: Display the numbers of the array after sorting
Data Structure: A one Dimensional array of elements
discussion: size is the size of the array 'array'

Steps:

1: Start
2: Read arr //array of numbers
3: For i=0 to size do
    3.1: Print arr[i]
4: EndFor
5: for i = 1 to size do
    5.1: key ← arr[i]
    5.2: j ← i - 1
    5.5: While j >= 0 AND arr[j] > key do
        5.5.1: arr[j+1] ← arr[j]
        5.5.2: j ← j - 1
    5.4: EndWhile
    5.5: arr[j+1] ← key
6: EndFor
7: For i = 0 to size do
    7.1: Print arr[i]
8: EndFor
9: Stop
