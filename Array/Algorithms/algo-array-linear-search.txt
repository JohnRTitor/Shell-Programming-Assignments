                Algorithm - Array Linear search

Input:- A array of numbers (arr), a number to be searched (search_for)
Output:- The position of the number to be searched (pos)

Steps:-

1: Start
2: Print "Enter space-separated numbers: "
3: Read arr
4: Print "Enter the number to search: "
5: Read search_for
6: found ← false
7: position ← 1 // Set initial position to 1
8: For i=0 to len(arr) do // len function calculates length of the array
    8.1: If arr[i] = search_for then
        8.1.1: Print search_for, " found in position #", position
        8.1.2: found ← true
    8.2: EndIf
    8.3: position ← position + 1
9: EndFor
10: If found = false then
    10.1: search_for, " not found in the array."
11: EndIf
12: Stop
