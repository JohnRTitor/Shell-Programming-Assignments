# Contributing to the Shell Programming Repository

Thank you for considering contributing to the Shell Programming repository! To maintain consistency and quality, we have established some guidelines for contributions.

## Code Guidelines

- Only contributions in Bash are accepted. We aim to maintain the focus on Bash scripting for this repository.

- All code files in this repository should include a shebang at the top, specifically using `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

- It is recommended that each `.sh` code file be accompanied by its corresponding pseudocode, which should be added to the "Algorithms" subfolder. This will help improve the understanding and documentation of the code.


- Please adhere to the following common Bash styling guidelines:
  - Indentation is mandatory. Use four spaces for each level of indentation.
  - Use descriptive variable and function names to enhance code readability.
  - Keep lines of code within a reasonable character limit (e.g., 80-100 characters) to improve code legibility.
  - Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic or provide context.
  - Use snake_case for variables and functions, and kebab-case for file names. Keep styling consistent.
  - Avoid using excessive global variables; prefer local variables within functions whenever possible.
